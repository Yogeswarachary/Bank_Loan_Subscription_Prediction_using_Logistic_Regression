# Bank_Loan_Subscription_Prediction_using_Logistic_Regression
Predicting Bank loan subscriptions, with the help of Logistic_Regression algorithm.

######  Training_data
> In this you will found the excel file called 'bank_loan_prediction_training_data.xlsx". It is having the 31647 rows and 18 columns. this excel file is used as the training dataset. I have mentioned all the nessesary information related to this file clearly in the coding file. just read those information about this excel file.

###### Testing_data
> In this you will found the excel file called "bank_loan_prediction_testing_data.xlsx". It is having the 13564 rows and 17 columns. as we can see that training data have the 18 columns (last column is subscribed), and in testing data the 18th column called the subscribed is not pressented. we have to predict this subscribed column, with help of Logistic_Regression algorithm.

In this python coding file called "project_based_on_logistic_regression.ipynb", I have mentioned all the information related to the each and every line of code in the coding.
